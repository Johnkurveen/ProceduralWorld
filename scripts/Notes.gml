/*Notes to self
-Import resource information
-Create resource array reference. 2D, properties. Rarity, land/water, offsets, etc
-Create 3d array to hold resource information
-Generate resources. Save to chunk
-Read values from chunk, write to mouseover
-Calibrate Noise
Apply resource offsets
Remove unused





**Use resources/water to generate towns
**Towns based on multiple terms- resources (combination), water, random(xy), distance between
**weights? 40, 20, 60, 20? Random term should be big- controllable
Make a map of loaded chunk's highest point. Grid and value. Able to add more data
Unload when not needed

Town-specific data will need to be stored perminently
Once established, let it spread? Clumpped?

Economy next? Add trading code?


Possibly add deserts and jungles? Later
